      "Course - Can I still join the course after the start date?\n",
      "Yes, even if you don't register, you're still eligible to submit the homeworks. \n",
      "Be aware, however, that there will be deadlines for turning in the final projects. So don't leave everything for the last minute.\n",
      "Course - I have registered for the Data Engineering Bootcamp. When can I expect to receive the confirmation email?\n",
      "You don't need it. You're accepted. You can also just start learning and submitting homework without registering. It is not checked against any registered list. Registration is just to gauge interest before the start date.\n",
      "Course - What can I do before the course starts? \n",
      "You can start by installing and setting up all the dependencies and requirements:\n",
      "Google cloud account  \n",
      "Google Cloud SDK\n",
      "Python 3 (installed with Anaconda)\n",
      "Terraform\n",
      "Git\n",
      "Look over the prerequisites and syllabus to see if you are comfortable with these subjects. \n",
      "Course - how many Zoomcamps in a year?\n",
      "There are multiple Zoomcamps in a year, as of 2024. However, they are for separate courses:\n",
      "Data-Engineering (Jan - Apr)\n",
      "MLOps (May - Aug)\n",
      "Machine Learning (Sep - Jan)\t\n",
      "LLM (June-)\n",
      "There's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year, for the certification. Same as for the other Zoomcamps. \n",
      "They follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort per zoomcamp. For Data-Engineering it is (generally) from Jan-Apr of the year. If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any zoom camps at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort. \n",
      "Course - Is the current cohort going to be different from the previous cohort?\n",
      "Yes. For the 2024 edition we are using Mage AI instead of Prefect and re-recorded the terraform videos, For 2023, we used Prefect instead of Airflow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\n",
      "Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\n",
      "You can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Course - Can I get support if I take the course in the self-paced mode?\n",
      "Yes, the slack channel remains open and you can ask questions there. But always sDocker containers exit code w search the channel first and second, check the FAQ (this document), most likely all your questions are already answered here.\n",
      "You can also tag the bot @ZoomcampQABot to help you conduct the search, but don’t rely on its answers 100%, it is pretty good though.  \n",

      "Course - Which playlist on YouTube should I refer to?\n",
      "All the main videos are stored in the Main “DATA ENGINEERING” playlist (no year specified). The Github repository has also been updated to show each video with a thumbnail, that would bring you directly to the same playlist below.\n",
      "Below is the MAIN PLAYLIST’. And then you refer to the year specific playlist for additional videos for that year like for office hours videos etc. Also find this playlist pinned to the slack channel.\n",

      "Course - ​​How many hours per week am I expected to spend on this  course?\n",
      "It depends on your background and previous experience with modules. It is expected to require about 5 - 15 hours per week. [source1] [source2] \n",
      "\n",
      "You can also calculate it yourself using this data and then update this answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",
      "\n",
      "Office Hours - What is the video/zoom link to the stream for the “Office Hour” or workshop sessions? \n",
      "The zoom link is only published to instructors/presenters/TAs.\n",
      "Students participate via Youtube Live and submit questions to Slido (link would be pinned in the chat when Alexey goes Live). The video URL should be posted in the announcements channel on Telegram & Slack before it begins. Also, you will see it live on the DataTalksClub YouTube Channel.\n",
      "Don’t post your questions in chat as it would be off-screen before the instructors/moderators have a chance to answer it if the room is very active.\n",
      "\n",
      "Office Hours - I can’t attend the “Office hours” / workshop, will it be recorded?\n",
      "Yes! Every “Office Hours” will be recorded and available a few minutes after the live session is over; so you can view (or rewatch) whenever you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Homework - What are homework and project deadlines?\n",

      "Homework and Leaderboard - what is the system for points in the course management platform?\n",
      "After you submit your homework it will be graded based on the amount of questions in a particular homework. You can see how many points you have right on the page of the homework up top. Additionally in the leaderboard you will find the sum of all points you’ve earned - points for Homeworks, FAQs and Learning in Public. If homework is clear, others work as follows: if you submit something to FAQ, you get one point, for each learning in a public link you get one point. \n",

      "Environment - Is Python 3.9 still the recommended version to use in 2024?\n",
      "Yes, for simplicity (of troubleshooting against the recorded videos) and stability. [source]\n",
      "But Python 3.10 and 3.11 should work fine.\n",
      "Environment - Should I use my local machine, GCP, or GitHub Codespaces for my environment?\n",
      "You can set it up on your laptop or PC if you prefer to work locally from your laptop or PC.\n",
      "You might face some challenges, especially for Windows users. If you face cnd2\n",
      "If you prefer to work on the local machine, you may start with the week 1 Introduction to Docker and follow through.\n",
      "However, if you prefer to set up a virtual machine, you may start with these first:\n",
      "Using GitHub Codespaces\n",
      "Setting up the environment on a cloudV Mcodespace\n",
      "I decided to work on a virtual machine because I have different laptops & PCs for my home & office, so I can work on this boot camp virtually anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - Is GitHub codespaces an alternative to using cli/git bash to ingest the data and create a docker file?\n",
      "GitHub Codespaces offers you computing Linux resources with many pre-installed tools (Docker, Docker Compose, Python).\n",
      "You can also open any GitHub repository in a GitHub Codespace.\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - Do we really have to use GitHub codespaces? I already have PostgreSQL & Docker installed.\n",
      "It's up to you which platform and environment you use for the course.\n",
      "Github codespaces or GCP VM are just possible options, but you can do the entire course from your laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - Do I need both GitHub Codespaces and GCP?\n",
      "Choose the approach that aligns the most with your idea for the end project\n",
      "One of those should suffice. However, BigQuery, which is part of GCP, will be used, so learning that is probably a better option. Or you can set up a local environment for most of this course.\n",
      "Environment - Could not establish connection to \"MyServerName\": Got bad result from install script\n",
      "This happens when attempting to connect to a GCP VM using VSCode on a Windows machine. Changing registry value in registry editor \n",
      "\n",
      "1. To open Run command window, you can either: \n",
      "(1-1) Use the shortcut keys: 'Windows + R', or \n",
      "(1-2) Right Click \"Start\", and click \"Run\" to open. \n",
      "2. Registry Values Located in Registry Editor, to open it: Type 'regedit' in the Run command window, and then press Enter.' 3. Now you can change the registry values \"Autorun\" in \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\" from \"if exists\" to a blank.\n",
      "Alternatively, You can simplify the solution by deleting the fingerprint saved within the known_hosts file. In Windows, this file is placed at  C:\\Users\\<your_user_name>\\.ssh\\known_host\n",
      "Environment - Why are we using GCP and not other cloud providers?GCP \n",
      "For uniformity at least, but you’re not restricted to GCP, you can use other cloud platforms like AWS if you’re comfortable with other cloud platforms, since you get every service that’s been provided by GCP in Azure and AWS or others..\n",
      "Because everyone has a google account, GCP has a free trial period and gives $300 in credits  to new users. Also, we are working with BigQuery, which is a part of GCP.\n",
      "Note that to sign up for a free GCP account, you must have a valid credit card.\n",
      "Should I pay for cloud services?\n",
      "No, if you use and take advantage of their free trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - The GCP and other cloud providers are unavailable in some countries. Is it possible to provide a guide to installing a home lab?\n",
      "You can do most of the course without a cloud. Almost everything we use (excluding BigQuery) can be run locally. We won’t be able to provide guidelines for some things, but most of the materials are runnable without GCP.\n",
      "For everything in the course, there’s a local alternative. You could even do the whole course locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - I want to use AWS. May I do that?\n",
      "Yes, you can. Just remember to adapt all the information on the videos to AWS. Besides, the final capstone will be evaluated based on the task: Create a data pipeline! Develop a visualisation!\n",
      "The problem would be when you need help. You’d need to rely on  fellow coursemates who also use AWS (or have experience using it before), which might be in smaller numbers than those learning the course with GCP.\n",
      "Also see Is it possible to use x tool instead of the one tool you use?\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the “Office Hour” which are the live zoom calls?\n",
      "We will probably have some calls during the Capstone period to clear some questions but it will be announced in advance if that happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are we still using the NYC Trip data for January 2021? Or are we using the 2022 data? \n",
      "We will use the same data, as the project will essentially remain the same as last year’s. The data is available here\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the 2022 repo deleted?\n",
      "No, but we moved the 2022 stuff here \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I use Airflow instead for my final project? \n",
      "Yes, you can use any tool you want for your project.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course? \n",
      "Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio. \n",
      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we contribute to the course?\n",
      "Star the repo! Share it with friends if you find it useful ❣️\n",
      "Create a PR if you see you can improve the text or the structure of the repository. \n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - Is the course [Windows/mac/Linux/...] friendly? \n",
      "Yes! Linux is ideal but technically it should not matter. Students last year used all 3 OSes successfully \n",
      "\n",
      "Environment - Roadblock for Windows users in modules with *.sh (shell scripts). \n",
      "Have no idea how past cohorts got past this as I haven't read old slack messages, and no FAQ entries that I can find.\n",
      "Later modules (module-05 & RisingWave workshop) use shell scripts in *.sh files and most Windows users not using WSL would hit a wall and cannot continue, even in git bash or MINGW64. This is why WSL environment setup is recommended from the start.\n",
      "Any books or additional resources you recommend? \n",
