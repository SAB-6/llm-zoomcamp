"Based on the context provided, the reason for getting NaNs after using .mean() in the rmse function was due to NaN values in the array.

"Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization term to the linear regression cost function. It helps in predictive modeling by mitigating multicollinearity issues and preventing overfitting. The alpha parameter controls the strength of the regularization in Ridge regression, with a higher alpha value leading to stronger regularization. Ridge regression is useful for large datasets and can be optimized using the sag solver, which employs stochastic gradient descent. When dealing with convergence issues during the training of a Ridge regression model, it is important to normalize numerical features and encode categorical features properly before combining them into a single feature matrix for training.","Ridge regression is a linear regression technique used to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity (when independent variables are highly correlated) and prevent overfitting in predictive modeling.

"The facilitator used sklearn==0.24.1 in the lectures while the homework specifies a different version because in the homework you are asked to use version 1.0.2 of sklearn, which gives errors when installed with just ""sklearn"". The correct way to install the specific version for the homework is to use the full name ""scikit-learn==1.0.2"" while running the installation command.","When the facilitator was adding sklearn to the virtual environment in the lectures, he used sklearn==0.24.1 and it ran smoothly. But while doing the homework and you are asked to use the 1.0.2 version of sklearn, it gives errors.

"It is best practice to use the `--rm` option when running docker containers because you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system.

During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit.

The environment name is the name of the last folder in the folder directory where we used the pipenv install command (or any other pipenv command). E.g.

XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.

Mélanie Fouesnard
Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

"The Sequential Model API in Keras refers to a mode where you can start from an ""empty"" model and add more and more layers in a sequential order. It is implemented as chained calls of different entities in a more advanced mode called the ""Functional Model API.""","It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).
You can simply start from an “empty” model and add more and more layers in a sequential order.
This mode is called “Sequential Model API”  (easier)
In Alexey’s videos it is implemented as chained calls of different entities (“inputs”,“base”, “vectors”,  “outputs”) in a more advanced mode “Functional Model API”.
Maybe a more complicated way makes sense when you do Transfer Learning and want to separate “Base” model vs. rest, but in the HW you need to recreate the full model from scratch ⇒ I believe it is easier to work with a sequence of “similar” layers.
You can read more about it in this TF2 tutorial.

While correcting an error on neural net architecture, it is advised to do fresh run by restarting kernel, else the model learns on top of previous runs.
Added by Abhijit Chakraborty",3ac604c3,What is the Sequential Model API in Keras?,machine-learning-zoomcamp,0.5993074
"The Functional Model API in Keras allows for a more advanced mode of building models where you can separate the ""Base"" model from the rest, while the Sequential Model API in Keras is a simpler mode where you can add layers in a sequential order.","It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).
You can simply start from an “empty” model and add more and more layers in a sequential order.
This mode is called “Sequential Model API”  (easier)
In Alexey’s videos it is implemented as chained calls of different entities (“inputs”,“base”, “vectors”,  “outputs”) in a more advanced mode “Functional Model API”.
Maybe a more complicated way makes sense when you do Transfer Learning and want to separate “Base” model vs. rest, but in the HW you need to recreate the full model from scratch ⇒ I believe it is easier to work with a sequence of “similar” layers.
You can read more about it in this TF2 tutorial.

"It is recommended to do a fresh run by restarting the kernel when correcting an error in neural net architecture because if the number of channels is not explicitly specified in the Input layer of the model, and is instead defined as a variable, the model architecture will not have the value in the variable stored.

"To fix the error message stating that an object of type float32 is not JSON serializable in serverless deep learning, you need to convert the individual estimation values from numpy float32 values to base-Python floats before trying to serialize them. This can be done by converting the values to floats like this:

This happens when a model (in this case the dino vs dragon model) returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). They need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”.

In my particular case, I set up the dino vs dragon model in such a way as to return a label + predicted probability for each class as follows (below is a two-line extract of function predict() in the lambda_function.py):

3. For testing the deployment setup locally, you can use AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator) by running the docker image as a container and starting up an endpoint locally using a specific port. You can then test it by sending a POST request to the endpoint using a curl command.

"To fix the Runtime.MarshalError encountered during AWS Lambda testing, you should turn your response at lambda_handler() to a string by using str(result). This will address the issue of ""Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable"".","This deployment setup can be tested locally using AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator).
Basically, if your Docker image was built upon base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10) - just use certain ports for “docker run” and a certain “localhost link” for testing:
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
This command runs the image as a container and starts up an endpoint locally at:
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations
Post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command:
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'
Examples of curl testing:
* windows testing:
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d ""{\""url\"": \""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg\""}""

This error appears while using an old version of werkzeug (2.2.2) with new version of flask (2.2.2). I solved it by pinning version of Flask into an older version with pipenv install Flask==2.1.3.

"I see you are getting a pickle error that says it can't get an attribute on module __main__ when using waitress with a Docker container for predictions. This issue happens because when using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, which will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist. To fix this error, put the custom column transformer class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py).

Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
Using Dask, an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas.
